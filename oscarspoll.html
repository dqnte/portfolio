        This site is your basic polling site, built using React and Node. Users
        pick who they expect to win the Academy Award for each category. At the
        end, users can review their choices and see how many they got correct.
        Users could also see their rank compared to all other user responses.

        The fun part about this project was the deadline. We knew that if we
        didn't finish by the 5pm on February 9th then it would be useless. Not
        as high stress as a start-up I'm sure, but it was stress.
      </p>

        We actually deployed the app without a way to set correct answers. Added
        that feature in production. That was fun. The site is still live, but
        closed. We got 18 responses, which I was happy with. We deployed about
        an hour before it closed. Here are some screenshots:
