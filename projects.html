              Coreo (pronounced coreo) is a coreography assistance tool built
              for dancers. Coreo allows for choreographers to upload videos of
              10 second dance routies that their dancers can then practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coreo is a full stack web application built using React+Redux on
              the front end and Node+PostGreSQL on the backend. Coreo also uses
              Tensorflow to track the body positions of each dancer's routine.

              This is a website I made with a friend for the Academy Awards. My
              first website was actually made for this exact purpose, so it was
              fun to revisit the project a year later. The responses are mostly
              friends and family.
            </p>
            <p>
              The polling site was built with React, Node.js and Sequelize. It's
              closed now, but you can take a look if you like. Just submit yor
              answers at then end to view everyone's results.

          <h2>MP4</h2>
          <p>I did this thing where I looked into MP4 video compression. 
            I wrote some python scripts that could tranverse through an MP4 file byte by byte. 
            I learned a lot about binary files but all I was really able to do was spit out
            the names of each "box" inside an MP4 file. 
            It was cool though, so if your curious I can talk about it to. I didn't want to put it 
            front and center, ya know?</p>

            <p>
              This is a bash script I wrote to set up a React App with Node on
              the backend. The script also sets up Webpack and Babel which
              bundle all the React components and styles.
            </p>
            <p>
              With all these React projects, a lot of the set up can get
              tedious. This script makes starting a project real quick. If you
              want to use it I would suggest reading the instructions.
