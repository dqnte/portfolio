      <p>
        Coreo is a tool for choreographers to share videos with their dances and
        vise-versa. Choreographers record videos with their webcam that they can
        then share with their dance team. The dancers in the dance team can then
        watch and practice the routine. When a dancer has got the routine down
        they can then record their own dance, which is then compared to the
        original video using computer vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coreo is a single page web application with built with React on the
        front-end and Node on the back-end.
      </p>
      <p>
        The intial idea behind Coreo was building an application that could
        grade one dancer's based on another dancer's performace. We achieved
        this doing a combination of Tensorflow and web workers.
      </p>
      <p>
        While a dancer is recording their video, frames are sent one at a time
        to a web worker. The web worker runs the frame through Posenet, which
        returns the body positions of the dancer. When the video is done
        recording, we have a list of frames with individual poses. The web
        worker then sends these frames back to the main thread, which compares
        the frames to the choreographers video. The scores of each frame are
        then aggregated to one score which is the dancer's score for the video.
      </p>
      <p>
        The back-end uses a Node server, PostGreSQL as a DB for user information
        and Cloudinary for video storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a choreographer uploads a video, Node uses FFMPEG (a command line
        library for image and video processing) to split the new video into
        individual frames. Each frame is then passed to Posenet which detects
        the poses of the dancer. The poses are then converted to strings and
        saved in an PostGreSQL along with other video information. The video is
        saved to Cloudinary.
