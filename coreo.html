        Coreo has a lot going on.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbEfbmgOsj8" target="_blank"
          >This</a
        >
        link is to a 6 minute video of us breaking down how all the technologies
        fit together.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Coreo is a tool for choreographers to share videos with their dances and
        vise-versa. Choreographers record videos with their webcam that they can
        then share with their dance team. The dancers in the team can then watch
        and practice the routine. When a dancer has perfected the routine, they
        can then record their routine, which is then compared to the original
        video using computer vision.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The idea behind Coreo was building an application like Slack but for
        dancers and choreographers.
      </h2>
      <img

      />
      <p>
        As far as the UI is concerned, Coreo looks a lot like Slack. Every user
        is a part of a dance team. Choreographers post videos on the dance
        team's main page. It is then the job of the dancer to watch the videos
        and post responses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choreographers can also assign dances for users to practice. Dancers
        must then record their own version of the dance and submit it. The
        dancer's video is then compared to the choreographer's video, which
        produces a grade.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The difficult bit was the video recording and pose comparisons. We used
        a TensorFlow package called Posenet.
      </h2>
      <p>
        For pose detection we used a
        <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> package called
        <a
          href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/pose_estimation/overview"
          >Posenet</a
        >. Posenet takes an image, and runs it through a neural network to find
        a human shape in the image. The neural network then identifies the
        joints of the human figure and returns them as key, value pairs.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brain-dance/brain-dancer/master/coreo-example.png"
      />
      <p>
        We wanted the app to give dancers quick feedback on their results. To do
        this we decided to run our pose detection software on the user's
        machine. While a dancer is recording their video, frames are sent one at
        a time to a web worker. The web worker runs the frame through Posenet,
        which returns the body positions of the dancer. When the video is done
        recording, we have a list of frames with individual poses. The web
        worker then sends these frames back to the main thread, which compares
        the frames to the choreographers video. The scores of each frame are
        then aggregated to one score which is the dancer's score for the video.
      </p>
      <h2>
        The back-end uses a Node server, a PostGreSQL DB for user information
        and a Cloudinary DB for video storage.
      </h2>
      <p>
        We process a choreographer's video a little differently. Since we don't
        have any video to comapare it to yet we use Posenet on the server. Node
        uses FFMPEG (a command line library for image and video processing) to
        split the new video into individual frames. Each frame is then passed to
        Posenet which detects the poses of the dancer. The poses are then
        converted to strings and saved in an PostGreSQL along with other video
        information. The video is saved to Cloudinary.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a dancer records their version of the choreographer's dance, they
        receive the video from Cloudinary and the pose frames from PostGreSQL.
        This is how we can compare all the poses for a new dance on the client's
        computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        This application used many different technologies. We only had two weeks
        to complete it, but I was impressed with how it turned out. Truthfully,
        in today's age of video calls, COVID-19 and working from home, this app
        makes a lot more sense. We made this in December 2019, however if COVID
        has the impact that I think it will, we're going to see an increase in
        the quality of webcams and mics for personal computers. If that is the
        case, then I suspect there will be quite a few more apps like this.
        Anyways, tangent over, thanks for reading!
